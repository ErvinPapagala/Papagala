# Fix "Gabim në ruajtje" Error

The error "Gabim në ruajtje" (Error in saving) happens because the admin form tries to save fields that don't exist in the database.

## To Fix This:

### 1. Run Database Migration
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the content from `database-migration.sql`
4. Run the SQL script

This will add the missing columns to your `parrots` table:
- weight_grams
- color
- temperament
- health_status
- training_level
- can_talk
- is_hand_fed
- has_health_certificate
- has_breeding_certificate
- has_cites_permit
- has_microchip

### 2. Restart Your Development Server
After running the migration:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test the Admin Panel
1. Go to your admin panel
2. Try adding or editing a parrot
3. The save should now work without errors

## What Was Fixed:
- ✅ Updated Parrot type definition to include all fields
- ✅ Updated API routes to handle all the new fields
- ✅ Created database migration script
- ✅ Fixed image quality and sizing issues

The admin panel will now save all the detailed parrot information properly!
